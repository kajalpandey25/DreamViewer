</Typography>
<Typography gutterBottom  color="grey"  variant="body2">Feb 1,2023</Typography>

<Typography sx={{my:2}} gutterBottom variant="h5">Blockchain technology has become a buzzword in recent years, with many people associating it solely with cryptocurrency. However, blockchain is much more than just a tool for buying and selling digital assets. It's a revolutionary technology that has the potential to transform multiple industries by offering unparalleled security, transparency, and decentralization.</Typography>
<Typography sx={{my:2}} gutterBottom variant="h5">At its core, blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that stores data across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a unique cryptographic code, ensuring that the data is tamper-proof and resistant to hacking. This makes it ideal for storing sensitive information such as medical records, financial transactions, and personal data</Typography>

These computers, or nodes, validate the transaction by checking that the sender has enough funds to make the transaction and that the transaction is not a duplicate.
